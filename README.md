# Calldata Optimization

## Introduction

This is a simplified demonstration of how L2 Optimistic rollups reduce optimize their gas use. Rollups are L2 that process transactions off-chain and then stores them in batches in the Ethereum , so relying in this blockchain makes them extremely secure. This brings a very cheap and scalable solution. But we know that storing data on the mainnet is expensive, that's why rollups like Optimism or Arbitrum use this system to make it cheaper. Its called calldata.
